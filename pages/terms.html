            <p class="text">Ayrem strive to protect its users from fraudulent and scam activities in the crypto assets sphere. It is possible, that
            certain crypto assets are used for scam or any other criminal activity, as defined by law. In order to prevent this, it
            is necessary to take measures to ensure customer verification and security of financial transactions. One of the best
            measures is AML/KYC procedure, which allows to confirm, that you are a law-abiding individual or corporation.</p>
            <p class="text">Ayrem has a risk scoring system that is able to spot suspicious activity. If a transaction is flagged by the system, it
            is put on hold and the user is asked to pass AML & KYС verification. For the reasons of security, we are not able to
            disclose specific criteria of our system, however, it has proven to be very effective against money launderers, scammers
            etc.</p>
