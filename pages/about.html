    Hi, My name is Akeeb Ayomami Wasiu, a native of Osun State, Nigeria and i am the CEO of Ayrem services.
  </p>
<img src="../images/aboutbanner.svg" alt="" class="aboutbanner">
<p >I attended Ladoke Akintola university of technology Ogbomoso and graduated with second class upper credit honours in
urban and regional planning. In addition to this, I was trained as a c raftsman from the early stage of my life till I
completed my university education. <br>
It is clear that no Government can employ all the residents of her country, therefore, citizens have to be self-employed
in other to cater for their daily demands in a socially acceptable way and manner. having this at heart, I was
determined not to work under anybody except for consultation cases. Although in course of hustle tatics, i have worked
as an attaché for several private firms and government agencies but I have never lost my dream of becoming my own boss
someday, This dream, i have lightened up as a ray of hope in the heart of many citizens, that we still have lots of good
people with several potentials in Nigeria. <br>
In addition to my selfless activities, , I assisted a couple of persons, both those in Nigeria and in diaspora,
supervised their project efficiently and got their planning and architectural approval in most of the states in Nigeria,
all these i did in line with many other professions in the building industry.</p>

<div class="split"><p class="title">How the ayrem
brand started.</p>
<p>At the early stage, We started with the MTN data bundle plan which turned out to be a success, then i was still doing
some petty planning and architectural 2D and 3D designs just to make ends meet. Later on in 2016 , the brand name was
changed to Ayrem and has incorporated new sections tilll date. Now we have other value added servics, as we dont just
include Giftcards and Crypto currencies, we also take care of other transaction related services like the NEPA bill
payment.</p></div>

    <p class="title">We found a problem and we succeeded in establishing trust while solving it.
</p> <div class="split"><p>An incident took place when a friend of mine who was sent a plastic Macy gift card from his relative in USA requested
    our services which we were happy to sell and get some token but it was so unfortunate for us that we were scammed by a
    fellow Nigerian that promised to assist us with the sale.This made us research more into </p><p>giftcard and crypto businesses across the globe and I am happy that ever since we’ve started the business, we’ve always
    made people happy by providing them a fast and trustworthy way to buy and sell their giftcards with us. Currently we are
    now dealing with all types of giftcards, Bitcoin sales and sale of data plans respectively.</p></div>
